# Contributing to Hyperframes

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Hyperframes! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hyperframes.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`

## Development

```bash
pnpm install        # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev            # Run the studio (composition editor)
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm -r typecheck   # Type-check all packages
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @hyperframes/core test          # Core unit tests (vitest)
pnpm --filter @hyperframes/engine test        # Engine unit tests (vitest)
pnpm --filter @hyperframes/core test:hyperframe-runtime-ci  # Runtime contract tests
```

## Pull Requests

- Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for PR titles (e.g., `feat: add timeline export`, `fix: resolve seek overflow`)
- CI must pass before merge (build, typecheck, tests, semantic PR title)
- PRs require at least 1 approval

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---|---|
| `@hyperframes/core` | Types, HTML generation, runtime, linter |
| `@hyperframes/engine` | Seekable page-to-video capture engine |
| `@hyperframes/producer` | Full rendering pipeline (capture + encode) |
| `@hyperframes/studio` | Composition editor UI |
| `hyperframes` | CLI for creating, previewing, and rendering |

## Releasing (Maintainers)

All packages use **fixed versioning** — every release bumps all packages to the same version.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Bump version, commit, and tag
pnpm set-version 0.1.1 --tag

# 2. Push to trigger the publish workflow
git push origin main --tags
```

The `v*` tag triggers CI, which validates (build + typecheck + tests) then publishes all packages to npm with provenance attestation.

### Without `--tag` (manual control)

```bash
# 1. Bump versions only (no commit/tag)
pnpm set-version 0.1.1

# 2. Review changes, commit yourself
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: release v0.1.1"
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin main --tags
```
